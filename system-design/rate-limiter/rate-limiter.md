# Rate Limiter System Design

## Overview
A rate limiter is a system that controls the rate of requests a client can make to an API within a specified time window. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and protects the system from being overwhelmed.

## Components

### 1. Client
- The client making requests to the API
- Can be a web browser, mobile app, or any service

### 2. Rate Limiter
- Acts as a middleware between the client and API server
- Tracks request counts and enforces rate limits
- Can be implemented using different algorithms:
  - Token Bucket
  - Leaky Bucket
  - Fixed Window
  - Sliding Window

### 3. API Server
- The actual service that processes the requests
- Only receives requests that pass the rate limiter

### 4. Redis
- Used for storing rate limit data
- Provides fast access and atomic operations
- Stores key-value pairs of client identifiers and their request counts

## Key Considerations

### 1. Rate Limiting Algorithms
- **Token Bucket**: Allows bursts of traffic while maintaining a steady rate
- **Leaky Bucket**: Smooths out traffic by processing at a constant rate
- **Fixed Window**: Simple but can allow bursts at window boundaries
- **Sliding Window**: More accurate but more complex to implement

### 2. Storage
- Need for distributed storage to handle multiple rate limiter instances
- Redis is commonly used due to its:
  - Atomic operations
  - TTL support
  - High performance
  - Distributed nature

### 3. Scalability
- Rate limiter should be horizontally scalable
- Need to handle distributed rate limiting across multiple instances
- Consider using a distributed cache like Redis

### 4. Performance
- Rate limiting should add minimal latency
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Consider caching frequently accessed data

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Client Identification**
   - IP address
   - API key
   - User ID
   - Combination of factors

2. **Rate Limit Rules**
   - Requests per second/minute/hour
   - Different limits for different endpoints
   - Different limits for different user types

3. **Response Headers**
   - X-RateLimit-Limit
   - X-RateLimit-Remaining
   - X-RateLimit-Reset

4. **Error Handling**
   - 429 Too Many Requests response
   - Retry-After header
   - Graceful degradation

## Best Practices

1. **Monitoring**
   - Track rate limit hits
   - Monitor system performance
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns

2. **Configuration**
   - Make rate limits configurable
   - Allow different limits for different environments
   - Support dynamic updates

3. **Security**
   - Prevent rate limit bypass
   - Handle edge cases
   - Protect against DoS attacks

4. **Documentation**
   - Clear rate limit policies
   - API documentation
   - Error handling guidelines
