# Rate Limiter System Design

[‚Üê Back to System Design](../system-design.md)

## Overview

A rate limiter is a system component that controls the rate of requests a service can handle, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource usage. The system needs to handle high-volume request tracking, implement various rate-limiting algorithms, and maintain consistent limits across distributed systems. It requires efficient request counting mechanisms, distributed coordination, and a scalable infrastructure to support millions of requests per second while maintaining accurate rate limiting.
