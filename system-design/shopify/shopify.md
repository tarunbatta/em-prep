## Overview

Shopify is an e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create online stores and manage their sales operations. The system needs to handle product management, order processing, payment processing, inventory management, and customer interactions. It requires robust transaction handling, scalable product catalog management, and a reliable infrastructure to support thousands of concurrent stores and millions of daily transactions while maintaining data consistency and security.
