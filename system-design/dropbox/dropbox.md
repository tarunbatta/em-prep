## Overview

Dropbox is a cloud storage and file synchronization service that allows users to store, share, and access files across multiple devices. The system needs to handle massive file storage, real-time synchronization, version control, and secure file sharing. It requires efficient data deduplication, robust conflict resolution, and scalable storage infrastructure to maintain performance and reliability across global regions.
