[‚Üê Back to System Design](../system-design.md)

## Overview

Uber is a ride-sharing platform that connects passengers with drivers through a real-time matching system. The system needs to handle real-time location tracking, dynamic pricing, ride matching, and payment processing. It requires efficient geospatial indexing, real-time data processing, and a scalable infrastructure to support millions of concurrent users and their location-based requests while maintaining low latency and high reliability.
