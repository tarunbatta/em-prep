# Google Docs System Design

[‚Üê Back to System Design](../system-design.md)

## Overview

Google Docs is a cloud-based document editing and collaboration platform that enables real-time collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. The system needs to handle concurrent editing, conflict resolution, real-time synchronization, and seamless integration with other Google services. It requires robust operational transformation algorithms, efficient state management, and a scalable infrastructure to support multiple users editing the same document simultaneously.
