## Overview

A parking garage system manages vehicle entry, exit, and space allocation in parking facilities. The system needs to handle real-time space tracking, automated entry/exit processing, payment processing, and reservation management. It requires reliable sensors, efficient space allocation algorithms, and a robust infrastructure to support multiple entry/exit points, various payment methods, and real-time space availability updates.
