# Parking Garage System Design

[← Back to System Design](../system-design.md)

## Overview

A parking garage system manages vehicle entry, exit, and space allocation in parking facilities. The system needs to handle real-time space tracking, automated entry/exit processing, payment processing, and reservation management. It requires reliable sensors, efficient space allocation algorithms, and a robust infrastructure to support multiple entry/exit points, various payment methods, and real-time space availability updates.

## Functional Requirements

* Reserve a spot and receive ticket or receipt
* Able to pay
* High Consistency (no two people to reserve same spot)
* 3 Type of Spots (S, M, L)
* Price Flat Rate based on Type of Spot

## Non-Functional Requirements

## Back of the Envelope Estimations

* No of parking spots in a parking lot
  * (# of floors) * (# of parking spots)
  * 10 * 500
  * 5K
* Data Size for a parking slot
  * (# of parking spots) * (size per parking spot)
  * 5K * 1K
  * 5MB (which fits one machine)
* Data Size for tickets
  * (# of parkings) * (size per ticket)
  * 10K * 100 bytes
  * 1MB
* Data for 10 years
  * 10 * 365 * 1Mb
  * 3.65 GB (which fits 1 machine)
* What if we want to build 1 mil parking lots
  * build distributed solution

## API Endpoints

### Public API Endpoints

/reserve (garageId, spotId, startTime, endTime)
returns: reservationId

/payment (reservationId)
(External Integration with Stripe, Square etc)

/cancel (reservationId)

/createAccount (email, password, firstName, lastName)

Note: Optional could also integrate with 3P SSO

/login (email, password)

### Internal API Endpoints

/calculatePayment (reservationId)

/freeSpots (garageId, vehicleType, time)

Note: check what spots are available

/allocateSpot (garageId, vehicleType, time)

Note: Allocating spot

## Object Model

* end, timestamp
* isPaid, bool

User

* userId, int
* firstName, varchar
* lastname, varchar
* email, varchat
* password, varchar
* createdAt, timestamp

Garage

* garageId, varchar
* address, varchar
* zipCode, int
* rateS, decimal
* rateM, decimal
* rateL, decimal

Spot

* spotId, int
* garageId, int
* vehicleType, enum
* status, enum

Vehicle

* userId, int

### Concurrency

* only for Slot Service
* Steps
  * query for available slots
  * pick slot available
  * try lock on slot. If fails choose another
  * assign slot to vehicle, make it occupied
  * unlock

### Distributed

* Sharding of Data
  * Ticket and Parking Slot
    * based on garageId
