## Overview

Google Drive is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service that enables users to store, share, and collaborate on files. The system needs to handle massive file storage, real-time collaboration, version control, and seamless integration with other Google services. It requires efficient data deduplication, conflict resolution, and a scalable infrastructure to support millions of concurrent users and their collaborative workflows.
