## Overview
Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service that allows users to store files in the cloud, share files, and edit documents collaboratively.

## Components

### 1. Client
- Web interface
- Mobile apps
- Desktop sync client
- Handles file operations

### 2. Load Balancer
- Distributes traffic
- Handles SSL termination
- Implements health checks
- Manages session persistence

### 3. API Server
- Processes client requests
- Handles authentication
- Manages file operations
- Implements business logic

### 4. Storage Service
- Manages file storage
- Handles file operations
- Implements deduplication
- Manages versioning

### 5. Metadata DB
- Stores file metadata
- Manages user data
- Handles relationships
- Maintains file history

### 6. Google Cloud Storage
- Stores actual files
- Handles file chunks
- Manages replication
- Implements backup
