## Overview

Twitter is a microblogging and social networking platform that allows users to post and interact with short messages called tweets. The system must support real-time content delivery, high availability, scalability to handle millions of users and tweets per day, and features such as timelines, notifications, and trending topics. It requires efficient data storage, distributed systems for feed generation, and robust APIs for third-party integrations.
