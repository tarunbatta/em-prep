# Notification System Design

[‚Üê Back to System Design](../system-design.md)

## Overview

A notification system is designed to deliver real-time alerts and messages to users across multiple channels and devices. The system needs to handle high-volume message delivery, support multiple notification types, manage user preferences, and ensure reliable delivery across various platforms. It requires robust message queuing, efficient routing mechanisms, and a scalable infrastructure to support millions of notifications per second while maintaining low latency and high reliability.
